"""
A meeting is stored as a tuple â†´ of integers (start_time, end_time). 
These integers represent the number of 30-minute blocks past 9:00am.

Write a function merge_ranges() that takes a list of multiple meeting 
time ranges and returns a list of condensed ranges.

For example, given:

  [(0, 1), (3, 5), (4, 8), (10, 12), (9, 10)]
 
Your function would return:

  [(0, 1), (3, 8), (9, 12)]

Do not assume the meetings are in order. The meeting times are coming 
from multiple teams.

Write a solution that's efficient even when we can't put a nice upper 
bound on the numbers representing our time ranges. Here we've simplified 
our times down to the number of 30-minute slots past 9:00 am. But we 
want the function to work even for very large numbers, like Unix timestamps. 
In any case, the spirit of the challenge is to merge meetings where 
start_time and end_time don't have an upper bound.

Complexity
O(nlg{n})O(nlgn) time and O(n)O(n) space.

Even though we only walk through our list of meetings once to merge them,
we sort all the meetings first, giving us a runtime of O(nlg{n})O(nlgn). 
It's worth noting that if our input were sorted, we could skip the sort 
nd do this in O(n)O(n) time!

We create a new list of merged meeting times. In the worst case, none of 
the meetings overlap, giving us a list identical to the input list. Thus 
we have a worst-case space cost of O(n)O(n).
